# Squibbles

A strategy game in which you try to out-score your opponent by getting as many of your squibbles as possible to the bottom of a maze filled with blocks and other obstacles. Play against the computer, or against a friend.

Squibbles is built with [GDevelop](https://gdevelop-app.com/) and is based on the DOS game 'Bolo Ball' by [Soleau Software](http://www.soleau.com/).
